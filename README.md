# Neural Information Processing Systems
## Practical Assignment Code
### Group 19

This repository contains our code for the practical assignment of the Neural Information Processing Systems course, as well as a .mp4 file containing a demo of 5 iterations of our best agent.<br><br>
The `main.py` file is the main access point to our code, for running the entire evolutionary strategy algorithm. The `demo.py` file contains code for running episodes with the best agent. `demo video.mp4` is a video file of the `demo.py` script running with our best evolutionary agent for 5 episodes.
